# -Machine-Learning-Topic-Modeling-with-LDA-and-NMF

Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine-learning technique for finding the underlying semantic/latent topics given a large collection of corpus/documents. As a powerful technique for text analysis, topic modeling is one of the most important techniques across various aspects of applications and research.

Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), is one of the first algorithms that tried to solve topic modeling problems. LSA decomposed the document-term matrix into a separate document-topic matrix and a topic-term matrix by applying Single Value Decomposition.

Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is one of the Bayesian probabilistic topic models (BPTMs) for handling topic modeling problems. LDA is generally an improvement on LSA, which estimates topic and topic terms in a probabilistic way. In general, LDA yields better-predicted accuracy than LSA on topic modeling task.

In this project, we are going to implement Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), which is a linear algebra approach similar to Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), but with some improvements upon LSA.
